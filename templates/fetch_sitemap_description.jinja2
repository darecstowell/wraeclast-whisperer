This tool is designed to help you retrieve and parse sitemap links from a given URL.
This tool will optionally fetch the robots.txt file, extract sitemap links, and then fetch all the links listed in those sitemaps.
If the desired link is not found in the initial sitemaps, you can call this tool multiple times to continue searching through additional sitemaps until the required link is located.
Use this tool to efficiently navigate and find specific links within a website's sitemap structure.
