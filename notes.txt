^^ These probably are not what i'm looking for. The bundles are update files. They do not contain all the data needed to supply the agent.
Most likely, will need to download PoE2 on windows and access the .ggpk file. Then use a utility like PyPoe https://github.com/OmegaK2/PyPoE
to scrape the game data. Could then setup a cron to check if the file is changed and trigger the data scrapping pipeline.
